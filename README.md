# AnnotationSPA

This is a Single Page Aplication for annotating images and performing trials with humans for a research paper. Bounding boxes can be drawn on images, which then can be used in tasks such as training machine learning models. In this research, humans are being tested on their capacity to find defects in industrial parts (metal castings). The results are saved to a database and analyzed with queries.


### TODO:

- finish tutorial
- finish trial logic
- add user support (so same user can test more than once)
- add database support
- host it somewhere
